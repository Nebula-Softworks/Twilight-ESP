### The Pitch
Twilight, the extrasenory star.  
Twilight was made as to provide a beautiful and sexy ESP Library that met the new standard of 'looking nice' while maintaining an easy to use and bloat-free API for developers to use. Packed with full customisability, Twilight is open-sourced too! Why Twilight?  
It looks good. I can probably count with my fingers how many ESP Libraries as powerful as Twilight that look good. I mean sure Sense is powerful, but does it really look nice? And that brings me to the other reason, and that is the API. If you ever find a nice looking ESP, it is probably not even a Library - and even if it is, there is no way it is as powerful or simple to use as Twilight.  
So Start using Twilight, the extrasensory star, today.
