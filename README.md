## The Pitch
Twilight, the extrasenory star.  
Twilight was made as to provide a beautiful and sexy ESP Library that met the new standard of 'looking nice' with the classic drawing style, maintaining an easy to use and bloat-free API for developers to use. Packed with full customisability, Twilight is open-sourced too!
### Why Twilight?  
It looks good. I can probably count with my fingers how many ESP Libraries as powerful as Twilight that look good. I mean sure Sense is powerful, but does it really look nice? And that brings me to the other reason, and that is the API. If you ever find a nice looking ESP, it is probably not even a Library - and even if it is, there is no way it is as powerful or simple to use as Twilight.  
So Start using Twilight, the extrasensory star, today.

## Structure Of Twilight
A semi-rojo project made via modular luau scripts, compiled for usage by darklua. Semi-rojo as it is used for Luau LSP and Selene Linter, but doesn't actually sync to Roblox.  
As of Version 1.2, Twilight does not support usage outside of executors supporting the Drawing sUNC function.  
Prior to Version 1.2, Twilight was compiled for usage with maui by Latte Softworks.
